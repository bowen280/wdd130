        <p>Hello all, my name is David Bowen, I am a senior here at BYUI and I have enjoyed this journey so far. I am
            married with one son, and one due in a couple months. I currently work as a warehouse supervisor running and
            international department for medical supplies. I love what I do because it provides so many challenges and
            wonderful results. I am in business managment and I would love to learn more about technology to help me
            advance on my career.</p>
        <p> I'm looking forward to learning more in this class, building websites has always been interesting to me. One
            of my hobbies is DJing. I have always enjoyed performing for dances and entertainment, and it would be a
            great achievment if I could create my own website to help promote this hobby! I look forward to learning
            with everyone this semester. Good luck! </p>
